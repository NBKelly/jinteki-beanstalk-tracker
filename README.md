### jinteki-beanstalk-tracker

For greasemonkey.

Interfaces with enkoder's beanstalk api to present rank and beans within the jinteki.net interface.

This occurs both in the lobby, and in games.

You can set the specific season to track through the menu (current season is '3'), or leave it blank to just track lifetime leaderboards.
